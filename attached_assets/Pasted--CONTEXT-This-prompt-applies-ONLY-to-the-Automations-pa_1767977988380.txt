## CONTEXT
This prompt applies ONLY to the **“Automations” page**, which lives **between “Agents” and “Pricing”** in the main navigation.
The page already exists. Do NOT create a new page.
Match the **same visual style, layout depth, interactivity, and motion feel** used on the **Agents page**.

The goal is NOT to sell tools.
The goal is to help non-technical business owners instantly *see themselves* in the problems being solved.

This page must feel:
• Visual-first
• Easy to understand (even for a 10-year-old)
• Relieving, not technical
• Focused on removing friction and mental load

Avoid heavy paragraphs.
Prefer **icons, cards, flows, visual blocks, and light micro-animations**.

Do NOT include a “Try Me” button on this page.

## PAGE PURPOSE
Help visitors understand:
• What automations are
• Why they matter
• How they quietly remove work
• How they work alongside AI agents
• That automations are built intentionally by humans, not just AI

The visitor should leave thinking:
“Wow… this would remove a lot of stress from my business.”

## HERO SECTION (VISUAL FIRST)

**Headline**
Automations that quietly run your business in the background

**Subheadline**
We build smart systems that move information, trigger actions, and keep things running without you having to think about them.

**Supporting line (lighter text)**
If something happens the same way every time, it should not require your attention.

Use subtle motion:
• Slow background gradient
• Floating system icons
• Light pulse animations

## SECTION: WHAT AUTOMATIONS REALLY ARE (VISUAL EXPLANATION)

Title:
What do we mean by automations?

Instead of a long explanation, use a **visual comparison block**:

### Left side (Icon-based)
Manual work looks like:
• People checking inboxes
• Someone remembering to follow up
• Tasks being chased
• Things falling through the cracks

### Right side (Icon-based)
Automations look like:
• Systems responding instantly
• Information moving on its own
• Follow ups happening automatically
• Nothing getting forgotten

Short reinforcing line:
Automations do not replace your team.
They support your team by handling the boring, repetitive, easy-to-forget work.

---

## SECTION: REAL EXAMPLES PEOPLE RECOGNIZE (CARD GRID)

Title:
Examples you can instantly relate to

Use **animated cards or icon tiles**, each with a simple trigger → result flow.

Examples to include:

• Form submitted → personalized email is sent → team gets notified  
• New lead enters CRM → follow up messages go out automatically  
• Proposal sent → reminders follow up if there is no response  
• Payment overdue → polite reminders are sent without awkward conversations  
• Call booked → confirmations and internal notifications happen instantly  

Below the grid:
The key idea:
Things move forward without someone needing to push every button manually.

## SECTION: WHY THIS MATTERS (BENEFITS AS VISUAL SIGNALS)

Title:
Why this matters for your business

Use **icon rows or cards**, minimal text:

• Fewer things fall through the cracks  
• Faster response times without extra staff  
• Consistent execution every time  
• Less stress for your team  
• More time focused on decisions and growth  

Short emphasis line:
Automation is not about doing more work.
It is about removing unnecessary work.

---

## SECTION: HOW WE BUILD AUTOMATIONS (PROCESS VISUAL)

Title:
How we build automations

Avoid technical diagrams.
Use a **step-based visual flow**:

Step 1:
Understand how your business currently works

Step 2:
Identify where things slow down or get forgotten

Step 3:
Decide what should happen automatically versus manually

Step 4:
Design systems that fit your workflows, tools, and goals

Closing line:
Some automations are simple.
Some are complex.
All of them are built intentionally.

## SECTION: AUTOMATIONS AND AI AGENTS (CLEAR DIFFERENTIATION)

Title:
Automations and AI agents work together

Use a **two-card comparison**, visual-first:

### Automations
• Handle structured, rule-based tasks  
• Move information reliably between systems  
• Follow predefined workflows  

### AI Agents
• Handle conversations and decisions  
• Adapt to context  
• Respond intelligently  

Below both cards:
Sometimes they work independently.
Sometimes they work together.

Final reinforcing statement:
The goal is not technology for the sake of technology.
The goal is smoother operations and less friction across your business.
