You are working on the **Pricing** page of the Sourcy website.

This task applies **ONLY** to the **Full Stack Bundle** pricing card and its **“Contact Sales”** button.
Do NOT change Text Agents or Voice Agents modals/flows.

# GOAL
When the user clicks **“Contact Sales”** on the **Full Stack Bundle** card, open a **modal** (popup) that captures lead details for a bundle-level conversation.

The modal must feel:
- Premium, modern, confident
- Minimal copy (no long explanations)
- Consistent with Sourcy’s dark gradient + subtle glow style
- Invitation-based (not salesy)

---

# MODAL STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

## Header
**Title (short + confident):**
**“Build Your Full Stack Agent System”**

**One-line statement (impactful, not hype):**
**“Combine voice, text, and workflows into one system that runs your operations—without the back-and-forth.”**

(Do not add more paragraphs.)

Close icon on the top-right. ESC closes. Background dim/blur.
