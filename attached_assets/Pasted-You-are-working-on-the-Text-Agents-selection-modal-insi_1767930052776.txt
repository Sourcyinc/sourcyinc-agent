You are working on the **Text Agents selection modal** inside the **Pricing** page.

This task is focused ONLY on improving **price clarity**.
Do NOT change layout structure, agent list, selection logic, or Stripe flow.

---

## PRICING STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

Each Text Agent must display **two prices**:

1) **Monthly partnership fee** (primary, visually dominant)
2) **One-time setup fee** (secondary, clearly labeled)

The setup fee must be visually smaller and clearly marked as **one-time**.

## CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Do NOT add explanations or long descriptions.
- Do NOT add ROI comparisons or human cost references.
- Do NOT change the “Buy” button label or behavior.
- Do NOT change Stripe placeholder logic.
- Do NOT change agent selection or quantity behavior.

## STRIPE CHECKOUT BEHAVIOR (MANDATORY)

When the user clicks **“Buy”**:

- Initiate **Stripe Checkout** immediately.
- Pass the selected Text Agents, quantities, setup total, and monthly total to Stripe.
- Use Stripe Checkout (hosted) for payment handling.

### Payment logic:
- **One-time setup total** must be charged as a one-time payment.
- **Monthly total** must be charged as a recurring subscription.

### Data to send to Stripe must include:
- Agent name
- Quantity per agent
- One-time setup amount
- Monthly recurring amount
- Currency: USD

Example structure (conceptual, not UI copy):
- Setup (one-time): charged immediately
- Monthly: subscription starting after checkout

### Constraints:
- Do NOT show Stripe UI until the user clicks “Buy”.
- Do NOT add extra confirmation steps before Stripe.
- Do NOT modify pricing calculations.
- Do NOT change the “Buy” button label.

Stripe handles the payment flow; Sourcy handles the configuration after checkout.
