## UPDATE EXISTING “GET STARTED” PAGE (FOOTER ENTRY POINT)

⚠️ IMPORTANT:
This page **already exists**.
Do NOT create a new route or a new page.
All changes below must be applied to the **existing Get Started page**, specifically when accessed from the **footer CTA (“Get Started”)**.

---

### 🔒 PAGE BEHAVIOR & NAVIGATION (FOOTER ENTRY)

When accessed from the footer:

- ❌ Hide header
- ❌ Hide footer
- ❌ Hide all navigation menus
- ❌ Remove any external links

✅ The ONLY exit path:
- Clicking the **large Sourcy logo**, which redirects back to **Home**

This creates a focused, distraction-free experience.

### 🎨 BACKGROUND & VISUAL STYLE

- Update the background to match **Image #4** (dark, elegant gradient).
- Maintain Sourcy’s futuristic, premium visual language.
- No flat colors. Subtle depth and glow.

---

### 🧠 LOGO REQUIREMENTS

- Display the Sourcy logo **centered at the top**.
- Logo shape and placement must match **Image #2**.

### 🧩 MAIN CONTENT (CENTERED)

#### Headline:
**“See how AI agents can actually help your business run smoother”**

#### Subheadline:
