You are working on the **Pricing > Compare Features** section of the Sourcy website.

Your goal is to improve **visual hierarchy, clarity, and decision guidance** without adding marketing hype or aggressive sales language.

---

## VISUAL PRIORITY (MANDATORY)

- The **Bundle** column must be visually emphasized as the most complete option.
- Move any visual highlight (background, border, glow, or emphasis) from other plans to the **Bundle**.
- The emphasis must be **subtle and elegant**, not aggressive.
- Text Agent and Voice Agent columns must remain neutral and readable.

---

## MICRO-LABEL ABOVE BUNDLE (REQUIRED)

Add a small, elegant label above the Bundle column:

**“Designed for real operations”**

- The label must be understated.
- No bright colors, no marketing badges, no “Most Popular” language.

---

## GUIDANCE LINE ABOVE TABLE (REQUIRED)

Directly below the “Compare Features” title, add the following sentence:

**“Different tools solve different problems. Most businesses end up needing both.”**

- Use neutral typography.
- This line must prepare the user mentally, not sell.

---

## FEATURE ROW STRUCTURE RULES

### Shared Features (CRITICAL)

- For features that apply equally to **two or all three plans** (e.g. Availability 24/7):
  - Place the feature once in the **Feature** column.
  - Use checkmarks (✔) in all applicable columns.
  - Do NOT repeat explanatory text in each column.

Example:
- **Availability:** ✔ Text Agent | ✔ Voice Agent | ✔ Bundle

---

### Channel-Specific Features

- Only add descriptive text where the behavior is different by agent type.
- Keep explanations **short, business-oriented, and understandable**.
- Avoid technical jargon unless it is obvious (e.g. Outbound Dialing).

---

## CONVERSATIONAL CONTEXT CLARIFICATION (MANDATORY)

When referring to memory or context:

- Make it clear that context is **session-based only**.
- Context applies **within the active chat or active call**.
- Context is **not stored or reused across different conversations**.

Do not imply long-term memory or cross-session learning.

---

## SETUP TIME RULES

- Display setup time as:
  - **Text Agent:** 5–10 Business Days
  - **Voice Agent:** 5–10 Business Days
  - **Bundle:** Varies

- Include a tooltip icon (ⓘ) next to “Setup Time” with the following explanation:

> *Time from contract to live deployment.  
> Includes agent configuration, knowledge base setup, CRM connections, and testing to ensure reliable performance.*

---

## STRICT CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Do NOT add CTAs in this section.
- Do NOT add pricing explanations.
- Do NOT add marketing claims or guarantees.
- Do NOT introduce new features.
- Do NOT remove existing features.
- Do NOT change terminology inconsistently.

The purpose of this section is **clarity and guidance**, not closing the sale.
