You are working on the **Pricing** page of the Sourcy website.

Add a **fourth pricing option** called **“Custom-made AI Agent”**.
This option is for users who don’t fit the Text/Voice catalog and aren’t ready to choose a predefined package.

Do NOT modify the existing three options’ copy, pricing, or flows.

## 4TH OPTION: CUSTOM-MADE AI AGENT (MANDATORY)

### Card title
**Custom-made AI Agent**

### Card positioning
- Place it as a fourth option alongside the existing three pricing cards.
- Maintain the same visual grid, spacing, and alignment (same height and baseline).
- It should be premium and consistent, but not more visually dominant than the Full Stack Bundle.

### Card microcopy (short, calm, consultive)
Use 1–2 lines maximum. Example intent:
- “Tell us what you need. We’ll scope it with you and propose the right solution.”

Do NOT mention any specific industry (e.g., construction).

### CTA button on the card
Label: **“Describe Your Idea”**

Do NOT add pricing numbers for this option.

---

## MODAL BEHAVIOR (MANDATORY)

When the user clicks **“Describe Your Idea”**, open a modal (popup) that matches Sourcy’s style:
- Dark gradient background
- Subtle glow
- Dim/blur page behind
- Close icon + ESC to close
- Minimal text (no long explanations)

---

## MODAL HEADER (MANDATORY)

Title:
**“Let’s Build What You Actually Need”**

One-line statement (no hype, clarity-first):
**“Share your goal and we’ll recommend the best agent setup—then price it based on scope.”**

---

## FORM FIELDS (MANDATORY)

Collect these fields in this exact order:

1) **Name** (text input)
2) **Last Name** (text input)
3) **Email** (email input)
4) **Phone Number** (tel input)
5) **Company Name** (text input)
6) **Industry** (text input, OPEN — NOT a dropdown)
7) **What do you want the AI agent to do?** (textarea, OPEN)

Textarea placeholder (short, guiding):
**“Describe the outcome you want. Include channels (text/voice), integrations (CRM), and any workflows.”**

---

## CTA INSIDE MODAL (MANDATORY)

Primary button label:
**“Request a Quote”**

Secondary:
**Cancel** (or close icon)

No other CTAs.
