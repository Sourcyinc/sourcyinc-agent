## Scope: Get Started Page Only

Apply the following copy and UI text updates **exclusively** to the existing **“Get Started”** page.  
Do **not** create new pages, routes, or flows.  
Do **not** modify other sections of the website.

This page is used as a lead-entry and guided consultation experience.

---

## Page Intent

This page should feel like:
- A guided conversation, not a sales funnel
- A serious intake, not a generic demo
- A place to explain real business challenges
- A human-reviewed entry point with clear criteria

Avoid sales language.  
Avoid plan or pricing references.  
Avoid terms like “buy”, “purchase”, or “package”.

## Hero Headline

**See how AI agents can actually help your business run smoother**

---

## Subheadline

**Let’s remove the busywork that slows your business down so you can focus on what actually moves the needle.**

---

## Central Information Box (Replace existing content)

Use a visually integrated container that blends with the page background while still drawing attention.

### Copy (keep this exact order):

**We’ll ask a few focused questions to understand how your business works today**

**You’ll have space to explain your challenges and how you think AI could help**

**Our team reviews every request and reaches out only when there’s a real fit**

Tone must feel:
- Human
- Intentional
- Selective
- Trust-building

---

## Agent Identity Section

Keep the agent identity as:

**Mr. Sourcy**

This agent represents:
- A guided intake experience
- A bridge between AI and a real team
- Not a generic chatbot

---

## Primary CTA Button

Update the button label to:

**Start the conversation**

The button should feel like:
- Beginning a dialogue
- Not starting a sales process
- Not committing to anything

---

## Microcopy Below CTA

**No commitment. Just clarity.**

Use a period, not separators.

---

## Footer Text (Bottom of Page)

Keep:

**Powered by Sourcy**

---

## UX Notes

- This page is used for lead qualification and consultation entry
- The agent will collect basic information and understand the user’s needs
- If the request is relevant, the lead may be contacted by the team later
- Do not explicitly describe scheduling, qualification logic, or internal workflows
- The experience should feel calm, intentional, and worth the user’s time

## Visual References

I will provide **three reference images**, in this order:
1. Overall background and page mood
2. Logo treatment reference
3. Typography and contrast reference

Use them strictly as visual guidance.
