You are working on the **Pricing > Compare Features** section of the Sourcy website.

Your goal is to improve **visual hierarchy, clarity, and decision guidance** without adding marketing hype or aggressive sales language.

---

## VISUAL PRIORITY (MANDATORY)

- The **Bundle** column must be visually emphasized as the most complete option.
- Move any visual highlight (background, border, glow, or emphasis) from other plans to the **Bundle**.
- The emphasis must be **subtle and elegant**, not aggressive.
- Text Agent and Voice Agent columns must remain neutral and readable.

---

## MICRO-LABEL ABOVE BUNDLE (REQUIRED)

Add a small, elegant label above the Bundle column:

**“Designed for real operations”**

- The label must be understated.
- No bright colors, no marketing badges, no “Most Popular” language.

---

## GUIDANCE LINE ABOVE TABLE (REQUIRED)

Directly below the “Compare Features” title, add the following sentence:

**“Different tools solve different problems. Most businesses end up needing both.”**

---

## FEATURE ROW STRUCTURE RULES

### Shared Features (CRITICAL)

- For features that apply equally to two or all three plans (e.g. Availability):
  - Display the feature once in the **Feature** column.
  - Use checkmarks (✔) in all applicable columns.
  - Do NOT repeat descriptive text in each column.

---

### Channel-Specific Features

- Only include descriptive text where behavior differs by agent type.
- Keep language **business-oriented and understandable**.
- Use technical terms only when they are obvious (e.g. Outbound Dialing).

---

## VOICE CAPABILITIES ROW (IMPORTANT)

- For **Text Agent**, leave the cell **blank**.
- Do NOT display “No” or “Not supported”.
- This avoids unnecessary cognitive friction for the reader.

---

## CONVERSATIONAL CONTEXT CLARIFICATION

- Context is **session-based only**.
- Applies only within:
  - The active chat (Text Agent)
  - The active call (Voice Agent)
- Context is **not stored or reused across conversations**.
- Do NOT imply long-term memory or learning.

---

## CRM INTEGRATION CLARIFICATION

- Add a tooltip icon (ⓘ) next to **CRM Two-Way Sync**.
- Tooltip copy must state:

> *CRM integration depends on the type of CRM used and must be reviewed and validated during setup.*

- Do NOT imply universal or guaranteed compatibility.

---

## REMOVED FEATURE (MANDATORY)

- Completely remove **Call Recording & Transcripts** from the comparison table.
- Do NOT reference this feature anywhere in the Pricing comparison.

---

## SETUP TIME RULES

- Display setup time as:
  - **Text Agent:** 5–10 Business Days
  - **Voice Agent:** 5–10 Business Days
  - **Bundle:** Varies

- Include a tooltip icon (ⓘ) next to “Setup Time” with the following explanation:

> *Time from contract to live deployment.  
> Includes agent configuration, knowledge base setup, CRM connections, and testing to ensure reliable performance.*

---

## STRICT CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Do NOT add CTAs in this section.
- Do NOT add pricing explanations.
- Do NOT add marketing promises or guarantees.
- Do NOT introduce new features.
- Do NOT remove any other existing features.
- Do NOT change terminology inconsistently.

The purpose of this section is **clarity and informed decision-making**, not closing the sale.
