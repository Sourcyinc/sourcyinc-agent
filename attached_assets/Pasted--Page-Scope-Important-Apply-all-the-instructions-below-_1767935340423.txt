### Page Scope — Important
Apply all the instructions below **only** to the existing **“Get Started” page**.  
This page already exists. Do NOT duplicate it, rename it, or reuse this layout anywhere else.

## Final UI & Copy Adjustments — Mr. Sourcy Page (Existing Page)

### Context
This page already exists and is live.  
The goal is to **refine visuals, copy, and brand cohesion**, not to create a new page.

I will provide **3 reference images in this exact order** to guide styling and layout decisions.

---

## 1. Brand & Logo Adjustments

- Use the **logo structure from Image #2** (icon + wordmark layout).
- Keep the **"Sourcy" text color and weight exactly as shown in Image #3**:
  - More robust
  - Higher contrast
  - Matches the rest of the site typography
- The logo should be **clickable**:
  - Clicking the logo returns the user to the **Home page**
- No header or footer should exist on this page.
  - The logo is the **only exit**.

---

## 2. Background

- Apply the **same background treatment shown in Image #4**:
  - Dark gradient
  - Soft lighting
  - No harsh contrast
- This background must blend seamlessly with the rest of the Sourcy site.

---

## 3. Headline (Keep Structure, Refine Tone)

Current structure is correct.  
Keep it, but ensure tone feels **human, calm, and confident**.

Recommended final copy:

**Headline**
> See how AI agents can actually help your business  
> **run smoother**

**Subheadline**
> Let’s remove the busywork that slows your business down — so your team can focus on what actually matters.

---

## 4. Information Card (Replace White Box)

### Visual Change
- The white box feels disconnected.
- Replace it with:
  - A **soft dark / translucent card**
  - Slight blur or glassmorphism
  - Uses Sourcy brand tones (teal / blue / dark gray)
- Increase font size inside the card for readability.

---

### Copy Update (Very Important)

Replace the first line **“Answer a few simple questions”**.

New content inside the card:

- **We’ll ask a few focused questions about your business**
- **You’ll also be able to tell us how AI could actually help you**
- **Our team reviews every request and follows up personally**

This must clearly communicate:
- The user is not wasting time
- This is not a generic bot flow
- A real human will follow up

---

## 5. Mr. Sourcy Section

- Keep the name **Mr. Sourcy**
- Keep the avatar and status indicator
- Button text remains:
  **Start Conversation →**
- Supporting line stays:
  > No commitment · Just clarity

Under the page footer:
> Powered by Sourcy

---

## 6. Interaction Behavior

- Clicking **Start Conversation** opens a **floating chat window**, styled exactly like Image #3:
  - Centered
  - Clean
  - Minimal UI
- The experience should feel:
  - Calm
  - Premium
  - Conversational (not salesy)

---

## 7. Summary of Intent

This page should feel like:
- A calm entry point
- A guided conversation
- A place to think, not to be sold

Tone reference:
- Human
- Confident
- Jeremy Miner–style clarity
- “We help you think, then we help you act”

No pressure. No noise. No distractions.
