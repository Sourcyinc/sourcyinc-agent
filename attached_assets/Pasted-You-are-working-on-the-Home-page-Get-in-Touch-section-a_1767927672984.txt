You are working on the **Home page – “Get in Touch” section** and its associated contact form modal.

Apply ALL changes below in a single update.  
Do NOT partially implement.

## SECTION TITLE VISIBILITY (MANDATORY)

- Change the **“Get in Touch”** heading color to **pure white**.
- Ensure it has enough contrast to be clearly visible on the dark background.

## INTRODUCTORY COPY UPDATE (MANDATORY)

Replace the current paragraph that references **construction** or any specific industry.

### REMOVE any mention of:
- Construction
- Industry-specific language

### REPLACE with a more human, outcome-focused message inspired by Jeremy Miner’s tone:

- Focus on:
  - Reducing wasted time
  - Removing repetitive work
  - Having something capable, reliable, and always available
- Avoid hype, buzzwords, or technical jargon
- Keep it calm, confident, and empathetic

### Example tone guidance (DO NOT copy verbatim):
> Helping teams stop spending time on simple tasks and focus on what actually moves the business forward.

The final copy should feel:
- Human
- Consultative
- Solution-oriented
- Industry-agnostic
