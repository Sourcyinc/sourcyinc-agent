## Updates needed (Home + Footer + Pricing) — do NOT change Custom Solutions behavior

### 1) HOME page — make the “Automations” button match the other buttons
- Keep the same layout and text.
- The “Automations” CTA currently looks flat compared to “Explore Agents” and “Try Me”.
- Update ONLY the “Automations” button styling so it has the same “life” as the other CTAs (same premium glow, depth, hover/active states, subtle shadow, and gradient feel).
- Do NOT make it look flashy or “christmas lights”. It should feel futuristic, clean, and consistent with the Sourcy theme.

### 2) FOOTER — Products column
- Add “Automations” under **Products** (same style as other links).
- Remove “About Us” from the footer completely.

### 3) PRICING page — Automations card copy (symmetry fix)
- On the **Pricing** page, inside the **Automations** pricing card, replace the long description with this shorter text so the “Talk to Our Team” button aligns visually with the other “Get Started” buttons:

**New Automations description (exact text):**
“Smart automations that run your workflows in the background.”

- Do not change the rest of the pricing layout.

### 4) NAVIGATION BEHAVIOR — always land at the top OR the correct section
Right now, clicking items (especially from the footer) sometimes lands mid page. Fix the navigation rules below:

#### Global rule (top of page)
- When clicking any main nav link in the header:
  - Home
  - Agents
  - Automations
  - Pricing
  - Get Started
The page should always load at the **top** (scroll to top on route change).

#### Footer “Products” links must deep link to the correct section
- Footer → **Voice Agents**
  - Must navigate to the **Agents** page and land at the **Voice Agents** section (scroll to that section) and ensure the toggle/tab is set to Voice.
- Footer → **Text Agents**
  - Must navigate to the **Agents** page and land at the **Text Agents** section (scroll to that section) and ensure the toggle/tab is set to Text.
- Footer → **Automations**
  - Must navigate to the **Automations** page and land at the **top** of that page.

#### IMPORTANT: do NOT change Custom Solutions behavior
- Footer → **Custom Solutions** is the only one currently working correctly.
- Keep its behavior exactly as it is (do NOT force it to scroll to top or change its target/anchor).

### 5) Implementation expectation
- Use correct anchors/IDs on sections (or route state) and force `scrollTo(0,0)` on normal route changes.
- For Voice/Text Agents deep links, implement a reliable “scroll into view + set correct tab” behavior after navigation.

That’s it. Make ONLY these updates.

### ADDITION — Header navigation must always scroll to top

Also add the following rule explicitly:

- When clicking any item in the **HEADER navigation**:
  - Home
  - Agents
  - Automations
  - Pricing

The page must **always load at the very top of the screen** (`scrollTo(0,0)` on navigation).

This applies **only to header navigation** and does **not** affect deep links handled from the footer (Voice Agents, Text Agents) or the existing **Custom Solutions** behavior, which must remain unchanged.
