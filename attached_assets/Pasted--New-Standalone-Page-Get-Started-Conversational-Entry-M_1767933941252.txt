## New Standalone Page – “Get Started” Conversational Entry (Mr. Sourcy)

I will attach **3 reference images in this exact order** to guide the visual and UX implementation:
1. Background / atmosphere reference  
2. Messaging card & structure reference  
3. Floating chat interaction reference  

Please use all three together.

---

### Objective
Create a **standalone conversational page** that serves as the main entry point to start interacting with Sourcy’s AI system.  
This is **not a marketing page**, not pricing, and not a quote form.  
It should feel human, calm, futuristic, and focused on helping users understand how AI agents can reduce friction in their business.

---

### Global Rules
- ❌ NO header
- ❌ NO footer
- ❌ NO navigation links
- ❌ NO way out except one
- ✅ The **only exit** is clicking the **large Sourcy logo**, which must redirect back to the Home page

This page must feel intentionally focused and distraction-free.

---

### Branding & Identity
- Agent name: **Mr. Sourcy**
- Footer text under the main CTA area:  
  **“Powered by Sourcy”**
- Use the **Sourcy logo** (same one used in the main header across the site)
- The logo should be **clickable** and return users to Home

---

### Background
- Use the **background style from Image #1**
- Soft gradient, professional, clean, modern
- Must visually align with the Home page aesthetic

---

### Main Headline (Center of the page)
Do **NOT** use:
- “Get Your Personalized Quote”
- Sales-heavy or pricing language

Instead, use a human, Jeremy Miner–style positioning.  
Example tone (you can refine copy, but keep the intent):

> **“See how AI agents can actually help your business run smoother.”**

or

> **“Let’s remove the busywork that slows your business down.”**

This headline should communicate clarity, relief, and usefulness — not pressure.

---

### Supporting Card (Like Image #2)
Under the headline, add a **small informational card** that explains what happens next.

Structure similar to Image #2, but with this meaning:

- Answer a few simple questions  
- Takes less than 2 minutes  
- We’ll review your needs and get in touch with you  

⚠️ Important:
- Do **NOT** say “our team follows up with your best options”
- Do **NOT** imply a call
- Use wording that implies **we will reach out**, not necessarily a call

---

### Primary CTA
Main button text:
**“Start Conversation”**

Subtext below the button:
> *No commitment · Just clarity*

---

### Chat Behavior (Image #3 Reference)
When the user clicks **“Start Conversation”**:

- Open a **floating chat window**
- The chat UI should visually match Image #3
- The agent must be clearly identified as **Mr. Sourcy**

#### Initial Message Example (tone reference):
> Hi, I’m Mr. Sourcy.  
> I help businesses reduce friction using AI agents — across text, voice, workflows, and custom systems.  
> Tell me a bit about what you’re trying to improve.

Tone:
- Human
- Calm
- Professional
- Helpful
- Not salesy

---

### Navigation Constraint
There must be **no visible navigation** on this page.
The **only way to leave**:
- Clicking the **Sourcy logo**, which returns the user to Home

This page should feel like a focused, intentional entry into a conversation — not a website.

---

### Summary
This page is:
- A conversational entry point
- A trust-building experience
- A bridge between curiosity and real solutions

Please follow the three reference images closely to match:
- Atmosphere
- Layout
- Interaction behavior
