You are working on the **Pricing** page of the Sourcy website.

This task applies **ONLY** to the **Text Agents** pricing card and its **“Get Started”** button behavior.
Do NOT change the pricing page copy, prices, Voice Agents flow, or Full Stack Bundle flow.

---

# GOAL
When a user clicks **“Get Started”** on **Text Agents**, they should be able to:
1) See the currently available **Text Agents**
2) Select **one or multiple agents**
3) Optionally increase quantity per agent (for multiple businesses/instances)
4) See the total price update in real time
5) Click a final CTA (e.g., **“Buy”**) that will later connect to **Stripe Checkout**
   - Stripe integration is NOT implemented yet (placeholder only)

The UI must feel:
- Futuristic but subtle
- Clean and premium
- Fully consistent with the Sourcy dark/gradient aesthetic
- Low-friction and experience-first (no heavy explanations)

---

# UI BEHAVIOR (MANDATORY)

## Trigger
- Clicking **Text Agents → “Get Started”** opens a **modal** (preferred for a clean, futuristic feel)
- The modal should:
  - Dim/blur the background slightly
  - Use the same dark gradient / soft glow style as the rest of the site
  - Be keyboard accessible (Esc closes, focus trap, close icon)

Do NOT expand a long accordion inline on the pricing page (keep the page clean).

---

# MODAL CONTENT (MANDATORY)

## Modal Title
Use a short, confident title such as:
- **“Select Your Text Agents”**

## Short Subtitle (1 line max)
- Example: **“Choose what you need now. Add more anytime.”**
Keep it calm and non-salesy.

---

## AGENT LIST (CURRENT TEXT AGENTS)
Show the currently available Text Agents as selectable items (cards or rows), each with:
- Agent Name
- One-line outcome statement (short, professional)
- Price per agent (monthly)
- Quantity control

### Agents to include (based on current catalog):
- Lead Qualification
- Proposal Follow-Up
- Appointment Scheduling
- Customer Service (Text)
- Invoice Generator
- CRM Analysis
- Payment Reminders
- Portfolio Analysis

(Do not introduce new agents beyond this list.)

---

# SELECTION + QUANTITY RULES (MANDATORY)

## Selection
- Each agent item has:
  - A checkbox or toggle to select/deselect
  - Selected state is clearly visible (subtle glow + border)

## Quantity
- Each selected agent shows a quantity control:
  - “–” and “+” buttons
  - Default quantity = **1**
  - Minimum = **1**
  - Quantity controls should be disabled/hidden when the agent is not selected

## Pricing logic
- Each agent has a price (monthly) used for calculation.
- Total updates instantly:
  - **Total = sum(agent_price * quantity)**
- Display total as:
  - **“Total: $X,XXX / month”**
- Keep calculations in USD.

---

# PRICE VALUES (MANDATORY FOR THIS MVP)

Use these monthly prices for the Text Agents selection modal:

- Lead Qualification (Text): **$900 / month**
- Proposal Follow-Up (Text): **$900 / month**
- Appointment Scheduling (Text): **$700 / month**
- Customer Service (Text): **$1,100 / month**
- Invoice Generator: **$600 / month**
- CRM Analysis: **$1,200 / month**
- Payment Reminders: **$600 / month**
- Portfolio Analysis: **$1,200 / month**

Do NOT show setup fees inside this modal for now.
This modal is for selecting and purchasing ongoing monthly plans (Stripe later).

---

# CHECKOUT CTA (MANDATORY)

At the bottom of the modal, add:
1) Total price summary (sticky within modal footer)
2) Primary CTA button:
   - Label: **“Buy”**
   - Subtext (optional, very small): **“Secure checkout via Stripe”**
3) Secondary option:
   - “Cancel” or close icon

## Stripe placeholder behavior (for now)
- Clicking **“Buy”** should call a placeholder function or route (e.g., `startStripeCheckout()`)
- The actual Stripe account connection will be implemented later.
- For now, it can open a placeholder confirmation or log the selected items payload.

---

# DATA OUTPUT (FOR STRIPE LATER)

Prepare the payload structure upon clicking “Buy”:

```json
{
  "plan_type": "text_agents",
  "items": [
    {
      "agent_name": "Lead Qualification",
      "unit_price_monthly": 900,
      "quantity": 2
    }
  ],
  "total_monthly": 1800,
  "currency": "USD"
}
