📍 PAGE CONTEXT  
This prompt applies to a **new top-level navigation item called “Automations”**, added to the header alongside:
- Home
- Agents
- Pricing
- Get Started

Place the new “Automations” navigation item in the header **between “Agents” and “Pricing”**, maintaining the same style and spacing as the existing menu items.

The “Automations” page should use the **same background, layout style, and visual language as the “Agents” page** to keep the experience cohesive.

🎯 PAGE GOAL  
Help visitors clearly understand:
- What business automations are
- Why they matter
- How they remove friction from daily operations
- That automations are built intentionally by our team, not just “magic tools”

This page should feel **educational, practical, and reassuring**, not technical or overwhelming.

## HERO SECTION (TOP OF PAGE)

### Headline  
**Automations that quietly run your business in the background**

### Subheadline  
We design smart automations that connect your tools, move information automatically, and eliminate repetitive manual work so your business runs smoother without constant oversight.

### Supporting Line  
If a task happens the same way every time, it should not require your time.

## WHAT AUTOMATIONS ACTUALLY MEAN (EXPLAIN IT SIMPLY)

### Section Title  
**What do we mean by automations?**

### Body Copy  
Automations are systems that take care of routine actions across your business without you having to think about them.

They do not replace your team.  
They support your team by handling the boring, repetitive, and easy-to-forget tasks that slow everything down.

Instead of people chasing tasks, systems move things forward automatically.

## REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES (VERY PRACTICAL)

### Section Title  
**Examples you can relate to**

Use short, easy-to-visualize examples written in plain language:

- When someone fills out a form on your website, an automation can instantly send them a personalized email and notify your team.
- When a new lead enters your CRM, follow-up messages can be sent automatically based on who they are and what they requested.
- When a proposal is sent, reminders can go out automatically if there is no response.
- When a payment is overdue, the system can send polite reminders without your team getting involved.
- When a client books a call, confirmations, reminders, and internal notifications all happen automatically.

The key idea:  
Things move forward without someone having to push every button manually.

## WHY BUSINESSES USE AUTOMATIONS (VALUE-FOCUSED)

### Section Title  
**Why this matters for your business**

### Bullet Points  
- Fewer things fall through the cracks  
- Faster response times without extra staff  
- Consistent execution every time  
- Less stress for your team  
- More time focused on decisions and growth  

Automation is not about doing more work.  
It is about removing unnecessary work.

## HOW WE APPROACH AUTOMATIONS (IMPORTANT CLARITY)

### Section Title  
**How we build automations**

### Body Copy  
We do not install random tools and hope they work.

We take the time to understand:
- How your business currently operates
- Where things slow down
- What information needs to move between systems
- What should happen automatically versus manually

Then we design automations that fit your workflows, your tools, and your goals.

Some automations are simple.  
Some are complex.  
All of them are built intentionally.

## CONNECTION TO AI AGENTS (WITHOUT CONFUSION)

### Section Title  
**Automations and AI agents work together**

### Body Copy  
Automations handle structured, rule-based tasks.  
AI agents handle conversations, decisions, and dynamic interactions.

Sometimes they work independently.  
Sometimes they work together.

The goal is not technology for the sake of technology.  
The goal is smoother operations and less friction across your business.
